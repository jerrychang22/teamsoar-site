Name: 3D Positioner
Date: Summer 2020
About: A device that can measure a position in 3D space relative to the device. The device has 3 degrees of freedom - yaw, pitch, and distance - to measure a point in 3D space. The information is relayed to a server via Websockets for responsive data visualization. The device can interface with other projects such as a robotic arm to give additional positioning information and instructions.
